SOCCER PLAYER ANALYSIS

Using a Kaggle.com merged data set from trasnfermarkt.de and fbref.com, soccer players from the top five
      European leagues are analyzed using statistics to determine the relationship to player value.

The purpose of this soccer analysis is to reveal the statistics that make a player or soccer club more valuable than the others.

QUESTIONS THIS ANALYSIS WILL ANSWER:
-WHICH SOCCER LEAGUE IS THE MOST VALUABLE?
-WHICH SQUAD IS THE MOST VALUBALE?
-WHICH NATIONALITY HAS THE MOST PLAYERS?
-WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A PLAYER VALUE AND GOAL DISTRIBUTION?
-AT WHAT AGE IS A PLAYER AT HIS HIGHEST VALUE?
-WHICH POSITION PLAYS THE MOST MINUTES, RECEIVES THE MOST PENALTY CARDS, AND WINS THE MOST TACKLES.
-IS ALL ANALYSIS VALUABLE AS IT RELATES TO ADDRESSING PLAYER VALUE?

EXPLORATION & CLEANUP
INSPECT DATA AND GENERATE CLEAN DATA SET

Correlation heatmap & Pairplot created to check for dependencies of the relationship between chosen variables.

CREATED BAR GRAPH TO ILLUSTRATE THE 5 LEAGUE VALUES

CREATED PIE GRAPH TO ILLUSTRATE PERCENTAGE OF PLAYERS DISTRIBUTED AROUND THE LEAGUES.

CREATED BAR GRAPH TO ILLUSTRATE SQUAD VALUES

CREATED BAR GRAPH TO ILLUSTRATE PLAYERS BY NATIONALITY

CREATED SCATTER & BOX PLOT TO COMPARE LEAGUE VALUES AND PLAYER AGE

PERFORM PLAYER GOAL STATISTICS: PTS/G VS. XG

CREATED SCATTER PLOT OF PLAYER VALUES WITH GOALS SCORED ; DETERMINE P-VALUE

CREATED BOX PLOT OF POSITIONS AND GOAL DISTRIBUTION

DETERMINE PLAYER AGE OF PEAK VALUE USING SCATTER PLOT AND P-VALUE TEST

CORRELATE POSITION WITH MINUTES AND PENALTY CARDS RECEIVED USING BAR CHARTS

CREATE LINE GRAPH TO COMPARE TACKLES VS. TACKLES WON USING PERCENTAGE

CREATED BAR GRAPH SHOWING PLAYER FOOT PREFERENCE - IS IT VALUABLE?

GENERATE ANALYSIS & CONLUSIONS:

The league with the highest value is Premier League at over $7.25B.

The percentage of players is distributed evenly across the leagues at near 21%.

Barcelona is the highest value squad at almost $1B.

Spain has the most players in the leagues with 325 of 2117 players.

T-Test analysis showed data significance since the p-value is very low (<0.05)

FW/MF positions have the highest goal distributions.

A playerâ€™s peak age of value is at 25/26 then declines.

DF position plays the most minutes and receive the most penalties.
 
Not all analysis is beneficial, as in foot preference.
